# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Your Development Server

## The Problem
The code changes have been made successfully, BUT your browser is still running the **old cached JavaScript code** that contains the problematic listener.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Stop Your Development Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal to stop the development server.

### Step 2: Clear Next.js Cache (Important!)
Run these commands:

```bash
# Remove Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Optional: Also clear node_modules/.cache if it exists
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Your Browser
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Safari**: `Cmd+Option+R` (Mac)

Or simply:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 5: Verify the Fix
Open the browser console and change the user's subscription in Firestore. You should now see:

✅ **What you SHOULD see:**
```javascript
🔔 [DashboardContext] Subscription changed: { from: 'base', to: 'pro' }
🔍 [DashboardContext] Permissions Debug: { hasCarouselPermission: true }
🔄 [AppearanceContext] Permissions/Subscription updated: { subscriptionLevel: 'pro' }
✅ [${id}] Using DashboardContext as single source of truth for permissions
```

❌ **What you should NOT see anymore:**
```javascript
📡 [xjz7e] Received appearance update from listener  // ← GONE!
✅ [xjz7e] Appearance data changed, updating state    // ← GONE!
```

## Why This Happens
Next.js uses:
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Build caching
- Browser caching

Sometimes these caches don't update properly, especially when removing code blocks like `useEffect` hooks.

## If It Still Doesn't Work
1. **Close ALL browser tabs** with your app
2. **Stop the dev server** completely
3. **Delete .next folder**: `rm -rf .next`
4. **Restart**: `npm run dev`
5. **Open in incognito/private window** to bypass all browser caches
6. **Test again**

The code is correct - you just need a clean restart! 🎉
