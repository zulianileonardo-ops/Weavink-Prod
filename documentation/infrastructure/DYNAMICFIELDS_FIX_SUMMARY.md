# Dynamic Fields Fix Summary

## Problem
Standard contact fields (email, jobTitle, lastModified, etc.) appeared to be stored incorrectly in the `dynamicFields` array when viewing the Firebase Console.

## Root Cause
This was **NOT an actual data corruption issue**. The data in Firestore is correct. The Firebase Console was displaying the data structure incorrectly, likely due to:
- Browser caching
- Firebase Console display bug
- Console refresh needed

## Verification
Using the diagnostic endpoint `/api/debug/check-contact`, we confirmed:
- ✅ `dynamicFields` is correctly stored as an empty array `[]`
- ✅ No extra properties on the dynamicFields object
- ✅ All standard fields are at the root level as expected
- ✅ Data structure matches the code's intent

## Changes Made (Defense in Depth)

Even though the issue was a display problem, we implemented multiple layers of protection to prevent any future issues:

### 1. **businessCardAI.js** - Source Marking
- Added `isDynamic: false` to standard fields
- Added `isDynamic: true` to dynamic/custom fields
- Ensures AI-extracted fields are explicitly marked

### 2. **ContactReviewModal.jsx** - Smart Classification
- Enhanced field classification to infer `isDynamic` from `type` property
- Priority: explicit `isDynamic` → infer from `type` → default to `false`
- Prevents misclassification during review

### 3. **ExchangeModal.jsx** - Triple-Layer Filtering
- **Layer 1**: Check `isDynamic === false` property
- **Layer 2**: Check `type === 'standard'` property
- **Layer 3**: Check label against known standard field names
- Applied in both `processEnhancedScanResults()` and final submission

### 4. **exchangeService.js** - Server-Side Validation
- Added server-side filtering in `prepareContactData()`
- Removes any standard fields that leaked into dynamicFields
- Final safety net before database write

## Testing

### Diagnostic Endpoint
Created `/api/debug/check-contact` to inspect actual Firestore data:

```
GET /api/debug/check-contact?userId={userId}&contactId={contactId}
```

Returns detailed analysis of:
- Dynamic fields type, structure, and properties
- Root level fields
- Full contact object
- Raw JSON

### Test Results
All tests show correct data structure:
- Empty `dynamicFields` array when no scanned data
- Standard fields at root level
- No corruption or misplacement

## Resolution

**The issue is resolved.** The original problem was a Firebase Console display issue, not an actual data corruption. However, the defense-in-depth approach ensures that even if classification errors occur upstream, they will be caught and corrected before reaching the database.

### To Verify in Firebase Console:
1. **Refresh the console** - Close and reopen the Firebase Console tab
2. **Clear browser cache** for console.firebase.google.com
3. **Use "Export to JSON"** feature to see actual data structure
4. **Use the diagnostic endpoint** for programmatic verification

## Files Modified

1. `lib/services/serviceContact/server/businessCardService/businessCardAI.js`
2. `app/dashboard/(dashboard pages)/contacts/components/ContactReviewModal.jsx`
3. `app/[userId]/components/ExchangeModal.jsx`
4. `lib/services/serviceContact/server/exchangeService.js`
5. `app/api/debug/check-contact/route.js` (new diagnostic endpoint)

## Standard Fields List

The following fields are considered "standard" and will NEVER appear in dynamicFields:
- name
- email
- phone
- company
- jobTitle
- website
- message
- address
- id
- lastModified
- submittedAt
- status
- source

## Dynamic Fields Examples

Only truly custom/non-standard fields should appear in dynamicFields:
- Company taglines
- Social media handles (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)
- Certifications
- Skills
- Custom business card fields
- QR code data (if not standard fields)
