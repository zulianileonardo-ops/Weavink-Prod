# Git Manager

Professional version control system for Weavink with automated workflows and intelligent commit message generation.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Commit Changes** - Create commits with descriptive messages
2. **Push/Pull** - Sync with remote repositories
3. **Branch Management** - Create, switch, merge branches
4. **Status Checks** - View git status and history
5. **Workflow Automation** - Integrate with test and docs workflows
6. **Commit Message Generation** - AI-powered commit messages based on changes
7. **Multi-Remote Support** - Automatically push to multiple remotes (GitHub + GitLab)

## Multi-Remote Configuration

This repository is configured to push to **BOTH GitHub and GitLab** simultaneously:

**Configured Remotes**:
- `origin` → GitHub (https://github.com/Leo910032/temp2.git)
- `Weavink` → GitLab (git@gitlab.com:website9841615/weavink.git)

**Default Behavior**:
- All push operations will push to **BOTH** remotes automatically
- Status checks will show sync status with both remotes
- One confirmation prompt approves push to all remotes
- Keeps GitHub and GitLab perfectly synchronized

**Commands**:
```bash
# View all remotes
git remote -v

# Push to all remotes (automatic in this skill)
for remote in $(git remote); do
  git push $remote $(git branch --show-current)
done

# Pull from specific remote if needed
git pull origin main
git pull Weavink main
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic backup to both platforms
- ✅ No manual syncing needed
- ✅ Single workflow works for both
- ✅ Always in sync across platforms

## Git Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Test → Docs → Commit (Recommended)
```
1. test-manager runs tests → All pass ✅
2. docs-manager updates docs → Confirmed ✅
3. git-manager commits both → User approves ✅
```

### Pattern 2: Quick Commit
```
1. User makes changes
2. git-manager shows diff
3. git-manager suggests commit message
4. User approves → Commit ✅
```

### Pattern 3: Feature Branch Workflow
```
1. git-manager creates feature branch
2. User develops feature
3. test-manager runs tests
4. git-manager commits to feature branch
5. git-manager creates PR/merge request
```

## Confirmation Protocol

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS ASK BEFORE ANY GIT OPERATION**

Before ANY git operation:
1. ✅ Show what will change (files, commits, branches)
2. ✅ Show the exact command that will run
3. ✅ Ask for explicit confirmation
4. ✅ Wait for user approval
5. ❌ NEVER commit, push, or merge without confirmation

**Especially important for**:
- Commits (show files and message first)
- Pushes (show what will be pushed)
- Force pushes (extra warning)
- Merges (show branches involved)
- Branch deletions (confirm branch name)

## Workflow Instructions

### 1. Committing Changes

**Triggers**:
- "Commit my changes"
- "Create a commit"
- After tests pass and docs updated
- "git commit"

**Process**:
1. **Check Git Status**
   ```bash
   cd ~/temp2/temp2
   git status
   ```

2. **Show Changes to User**
   ```
   📝 Changes to commit:
   
   Modified files:
   - test-index.json (12 lines changed)
   - documentation/rgpd/CONSENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (5 lines changed)
   - lib/services/servicePrivacy/consentService.js (8 lines changed)
   
   New files:
   - test-reports/rgpd-consent-2025-11-11.md
   
   Total: 4 files, 25 lines changed
   ```

3. **Generate Commit Message**
   Based on changes, suggest message:
   ```
   Suggested commit message:
   
   ✅ Tests: RGPD Consent Categories (12/12 passing)
   
   - Updated test index with latest results
   - Added test coverage to documentation
   - Generated test report

   # Check if there are commits to push (check all remotes)
   git remote
   git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

   # Check each remote to see if they're in sync
   for remote in $(git remote); do
     echo "Checking $remote..."
     git log $remote/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null || echo "New branch on $remote"
   done
   ```

2. **Show User What Will Push**
   ```
   📤 Ready to push to ALL remotes

   - origin → https://github.com/Leo910032/temp2.git
   - Weavink → git@gitlab.com:website9841615/weavink.git

   All remotes will receive these commits
   ```

3. **ASK FOR CONFIRMATION** ⚠️ MANDATORY
   ```
   ⚠️  About to push 3 commits to MULTIPLE REMOTES

   - origin (GitHub: https://github.com/Leo910032/temp2.git)
   - Weavink (GitLab: git@gitlab.com:website9841615/weavink.git)

   This will:
   - Upload commits to ALL remote repositories
   - Make changes visible to team on both platforms
   - Trigger CI/CD if configured on either remote

   Proceed with push to ALL remotes? [Y/n/view]
   ```

4. **Execute Push** (only after approval)
   ```bash
   # Push to ALL configured remotes
   for remote in $(git remote); do
     echo "Pushing to $remote..."
     git push $remote $(git branch --show-current) || echo "⚠️ Failed to push to $remote"
   done

   # Alternative: Push to specific remotes if you want more control
   # git push origin main
   # git push Weavink main
   ```

5. **Confirm Success**
   ```

## Git Command Reference

### Safe Commands (No Confirmation Needed)
```bash
git status              # Check status
git log                 # View history
git diff                # View changes
git branch              # List branches
git show <commit>       # View commit
git log --graph         # Visual history
```

### Commands Requiring Confirmation
```bash
git add <files>         # Stage files
git commit              # Create commit
git push                # Push to remote
git pull                # Pull from remote
git merge               # Merge branches
git checkout -b         # Create branch
git branch -d           # Delete branch
git reset               # Reset changes
git revert              # Revert commit
```

### Dangerous Commands (Extra Warning)
```bash
git push --force        # Force push
git reset --hard        # Hard reset
git clean -fd           # Delete untracked
git branch -D           # Force delete branch
```

## Error Handling

### Merge Conflicts
```
⚠️  Merge conflict detected

File: documentation/rgpd/CONSENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
Lines: 45-52

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Test Coverage
Coverage: 92%
=======
## Function Tests
All tests passing
>>>>>>> feature/updates

Actions:
1. Show full conflict
2. Abort merge (git merge --abort)
3. I'll resolve manually

Your choice: [1/2/3]
```

### Push Rejected
```
❌ Push rejected

Reason: Remote has changes you don't have

⚠️  Note: When using multiple remotes (origin + Weavink), you may
   need to pull from both remotes if they have diverged.

Solution:
1. Pull from origin: git pull origin main
2. Pull from Weavink: git pull Weavink main (if needed)
3. Resolve conflicts (if any)
4. Try push again to all remotes

Proceed with pull? [Y/n/abort]
```

### Detached HEAD
```
⚠️  Detached HEAD state detected

You're not on a branch. Changes won't be saved unless
you create a branch.

Actions:
1. Create branch: git checkout -b temp-branch
2. Return to main: git checkout main
3. Show current commit: git show

Your choice: [1/2/3]
```

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE COMMIT** - Never commit without user confirmation
2. **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE PUSH** - Never push without user confirmation  
3. **ALWAYS SHOW DIFF** - Let user see what will be committed
4. **ALWAYS VALIDATE BRANCH** - Check branch name before creating
5. **ALWAYS CHECK REMOTE** - Verify remote before pushing
6. **ALWAYS HANDLE CONFLICTS** - Guide user through merge conflicts
7. **NEVER FORCE PUSH** - Unless explicitly requested with extra warning
8. **NEVER AUTO-MERGE** - Always confirm merges
9. **ALWAYS INTEGRATE WITH TESTS** - Only commit if tests pass
10. **ALWAYS GENERATE GOOD MESSAGES** - Create descriptive commit messages

## Integration Summary

### Workflow Chain

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  test-manager   │ Runs tests, tracks results
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Tests pass ✅
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  docs-manager   │ Updates documentation
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Docs updated ✅
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  git-manager    │ Commits & pushes
└─────────────────┘
         │ Committed ✅
         ↓
      Complete!
```

### Data Flow

```javascript
// test-manager → git-manager
{
  files: ["test-index.json", "test-reports/X.md"],
  message: "✅ Tests: X (Y/Z passing)",
  testsPass: true
}

// docs-manager → git-manager  
{
  files: ["GUIDE.md", "docs-index.json"],
  message: "📝 Updated documentation",
  docsUpdated: true
}

// git-manager confirmation
{
  action: "commit",
  files: [...all files...],
  message: "Combined message",
  needsConfirmation: true
}
```

## Success Metrics

A well-managed git workflow should have:
- ✅ All commits have descriptive messages
- ✅ Tests pass before every commit
- ✅ Documentation updated with code
- ✅ Clean commit history
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ Regular pushes to remote
- ✅ Feature branches for big changes
- ✅ User always confirms before operations
